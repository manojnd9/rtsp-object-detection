# Real-Time Object Detection with RTSP

Detect objects in real time using RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and object detection model.

## Tech Stack Choices

1. Backend is built on Python 3.11 [older versions are generally not recommended and py>3.12 don't have much updates in the supporting libraries]
2. OpenCV: Widely used computer vision library for video streaming and image processing. It is also fast and optimised for real-time applications.
   2.1 With OpenCV video capture object, either the video stream or video file can be read -> processed and released.
   2.2 For connecting actual real-time video, RTSP camera app can be used as RTSP server -> take its URL and input to the OpenCV cap object.
3. RTSP Stream: With IP Webcam
   Tested with Androidâ€™s IP Webcam app for stable RTSP streaming. iOS apps tested had unreliable H.264 encoding leading to decoding issues. IP Webcam allowed clean integration with OpenCV via RTSP.
4. Choosing object detection model
   - Due to real-time requirement, single stage detector is better. Amongst available models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Stage Detector) and RetinaNet, YOLO is better as it is faster than others and has balance between speed and performance anc can be run on the CPU. And YOLO also has better community support. For skeleton implemenatation to get the framework running, YOLO is a best choice.
   - In YOLO, choosing the pre-trained model size impacts the speed and accuracy with nano being smallest/fastest upto extra-large which is most-accurate/slowest.

## Object Model Config and Stream URL setting

For the security purpose, `RTSP_STREAM_URL` is defined in `.env` file and loaded in the `main.py`.

Object model configuration can be added/modified in the `ModelSelector` dataclass and used in the `ObjectDetector` wrapper.

## Data Schema

1. `StreamSesssion` \
   Global session schema to help partion the way frames and detection results are stored.
2. `BoundingBox` and `DetectionResult` \
   Each detected object as a box has:
   - `timestamp`: at which the object was detected
   - `label`: name of of the object
   - `confidence`: confidence of detected objected by the model
   - `bbox`: bounding box coordinates
   - `frame_path`: path where input frame is stored
3. Storing streamed frames \
   - Save the running frame along with the timestamp within file name
     as jpg file. For now, the frames are stored in the local disk, for later it can be pushed to s3 buckets with proper partitioning.
   - Year, Month, Day and Session_ID is used to partion the folders to
     store the frames. It makes querying certain session data very fast.

## Database

PostgreSQL along with SQLAlchemy is used to manage the database storing and database sessions. This combination gives the advantage over schema control, querying and maintainace via alembic migrations.
