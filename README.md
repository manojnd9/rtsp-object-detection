# Real-Time Object Detection with RTSP

Detect objects in real time using RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) and object detection model.

## Tech Stack

1. Backend is built on Python 3.11 [older versions are generally not recommended and py>3.12 don't have much updates in the supporting libraries]
2. OpenCV: Widely used computer vision library for video streaming and image processing. It is also fast and optimised for real-time applications.
